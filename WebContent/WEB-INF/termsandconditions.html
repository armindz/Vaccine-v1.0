        <h3 class="text-center my-3 border-bottom ff-inter">Terms and Conditions</h3>
        <h5 class="ff-inter my-5 text-muted">Consent to Receive the Vaccine</h5>
        <p class="mx-auto my-2 ff-lato"> I have read (or it has been read to me) and I understand the Immunization Prepackage, including the following documents: ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Information Sheet’ and ‘What you need to know about your Covid-19 vaccine appointment’. <br/> I have had
            the opportunity to ask questions regarding the vaccine I am receiving and to have them answered to my satisfaction. <br/> I consent to receiving the vaccine, including all recommended doses in the series. <br/> I understand that I may withdraw
            this consent at any time. <br/> I understand that if I am withdrawing consent as a substitute decision maker of an individual, then I must contact the congregate setting that the individual resides in. <br/><br/> Note: Please contact the vaccination
            clinic where you are supposed to receive the Covid-19 vaccine if you change your mind and no longer consent to receiving the vaccine. This will allow someone else to take your spot. If consent has been withdrawn by a substitute decision maker
            of an individual who resides in a congregate setting, then the congregate setting must contact the local public health unit.
        </p>

        <h5 class="ff-inter my-5 text-muted">Acknowledgement of Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Health Information
        </h5>
        <p class="mx-auto my-2 ff-lato"> The personal health information on this form is being collected for the purpose of providing care to you and creating an immunization record for you, and because it is necessary for the administration of Ontario’s COVID-19 vaccination program.
            This information will be used and disclosed for these purposes, as well as other purposes authorized and required by law. For example,
            <br/>it will be disclosed to the Chief Medical Officer of Health and Ontario public health units where the disclosure is necessary for a purpose of the Health Protection and Promotion Act. And <br/>it may be disclosed, as part of your provincial
            electronic health record, to health care providers who are providing care to you.
            <br/><br/>The information will be stored in a health record system under the custody and control of the Ministry of Health.

            <br/> You may be contacted by a hospital, local public health unit, or the Ministry of Health for purposes related to the COVID-19 vaccine (for example, to remind you of follow up appointments and to provide you with a record of immunization).

        </p>


        <h5 class="ff-inter my-5 text-muted">Consent to Being Contacted About Research Studies</h5>
        <p class="mx-auto my-2 ff-lato">You have the option of consenting to be contacted by researchers about participation in COVID19 vaccine related research studies. If you consent to be contacted, your personal health information will be used to determine which studies may be relevant
            to you, and your name and contact information will be disclosed to researchers. Consenting to be contacted about research studies does not mean you have consented to participate in the research itself. Participating in research is voluntary.
            You may refuse to consent to be contacted about research studies without impacting your eligibility to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. If you do not wish to be contacted about research studies, you may withdraw consent at any time by contacting
            the Ministry of Health. This will not impact your eligibility to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.
